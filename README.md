java cChemistry 5224: Reaction Kinetics and Dynamics 
Problem Set #1: Due Tuesday, Sept. 17 through 11:55 pm; Submission through Gradescope 
portal on our Canvas class website. 
0) (i) Show that the equilibrium constant for the reaction A B with forward and reverse rate 
constants, kf and kr, is given by, 
 
(ii) Draw a schematic enthalpy diagram of the reaction as a function of reaction co-ordinate 
and label the transition state region, activation energies, and heat of reaction. 
(iii) Use your plot in (ii) to help you show that the choice of Arrhenius rate expressions for kf 
and kr is consistent with the van’t Hoff equation, 
 
 and the general definition for the activation energy,
